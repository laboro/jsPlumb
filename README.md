## jsPlumb
jsPlumb provides a means for a developer to visually connect elements on their web pages. It uses SVG or
Canvas in modern browsers, and VML on IE 8 and below. The latest version is 1.7.5; this will be the final version
(apart from bugfix releases in 1.7.x) to support IE8. The next major release will be 2.0.0, and this will work only
 in modern browsers that support SVG.

If you're new to jsPlumb, please do take the time to read the [documentation](http://jsplumb.org/doc).
There are a few integration issues that you should be aware of: z-index needs special attention, for example.
